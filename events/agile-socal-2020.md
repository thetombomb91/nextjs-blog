talkTitle: "The Life of a Mob Programmer"
talkLocation: "Agile SoCal Meetup"
description: "Mob programming is a software development practice that brings together three to five developers all working on the same thing at the same time. There's one computer, one keyboard, one task, and one group of people working together. Thomas Desmond uses mob programming full time on all production software because of the quality of the software produced. His team consistently has no reported bugs in production, and at one point they went a year and a half with no reported bugs in production. Join Thomas as he shares what mob programming is, what it is like to be a mob programmer, the benefits we get out of it, and some negatives about it as well. You'll leave excited about mob programming and thinking about how you can apply its principles in your own environments."
