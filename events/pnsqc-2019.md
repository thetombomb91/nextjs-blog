talkTitle: "Creating Quality with Mob Programming"
talkLocation: "Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference"
description: "At my organization, we mob program on all production code. We work as a group on a single task designing, coding, testing, and releasing all together. The most important practice that comes along with mob programming is the Driver Navigator paradigm. The driver is the person at the keyboard and the other members are navigators. For an idea to be implemented one of the navigators must be able to explain the idea in English for the driver to implement. This paradigm ensures that an idea can be explained and everyone else in the group can hear and comment on the idea before it gets into the code."
