My name is Thomas Desmond and I am a **Technical Evangelist at Sitecore** and former Senior Software Engineer. I was also a University Instructor for 3 years 👨‍🏫, teaching hundreds of students about mobile app development. I enjoy writing code myself and find even more joy in helping others succeed in code as well.

I have this site to share my thoughts and things I learn day to day while programming. A few personal articles make it in as well so I can remember some of my favorite camping trips ⛺

Over the past few years, my “hobbies” have been speaking at conferences, creating technical video course content, and maintaining this site.
