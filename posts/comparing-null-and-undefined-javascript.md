When first learning JavaScript I came across a new value _**undefined**_. I was familiar with and understood _**null**_ because of my .NET background but had never seen **undefined**. Let's take a deeper look at null and undefined in JavaScript.

## null in JavaScript

According to the JavaScript documentation: "The value _**null**_ represents the **intentional** absence of any object value" ([Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)). null represents that there is no value, and it is important to not miss the intentional aspect.

A value cannot be null unless it has specifically been assigned null. Let's look at some code:

```
let temp = null;
console.log(temp)
// will result in "null" being printed out
```

Above, on line 1 we are setting our value to null. null is powerful and something commonly found in code. There is even a [null object design pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object).1

## undefined in JavaScript

"A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `**undefined**`" ([Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)). If we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, its value is undefined.

```
let temp;
console.log(temp);
// Will result in "undefined" printed out
```

Since we didn't assign a value to temp on line 1 it is **undefined**.

"A method or statement also returns **`undefined`** if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value." So we would see undefined if we access a property on an object that does not exist or does not contain a value.

```
let person = {};
console.log(person.name);
// Will print out "undefined" because the name property does not exist on the person object.
```

We don't need to be scared of undefined it just means the variable has never been assigned or does not exist.

## null vs undefined equality gotcha

There is a bit of a gotcha when thinking about equality of null vs undefined. Let's look at examples:

```
null === undefined
// false

null == undefined
// true
```

In the first strict equal (===) case, we get false returned. This is because both null and undefined evaluate to false **BUT** they are different object types. null is of type object while undefined is simply of type undefined.

That is why the second case of only loosely equal (==) we get true coming back. It's important to realize the distinction that null & undefined are different types.

Having come from a .NET background I had not seen _undefined_ before. With a little research and playing around with code, it all came together. I encourage you to open up your console window now and mess around a little with null and undefined!
