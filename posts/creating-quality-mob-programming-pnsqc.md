A few months back I was accepted to give a technical presentation at [PNSQC 2019](https://www.pnsqc.org/2019-conference/) (Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference) titled Creating Quality with Mob Programming.

My final draft of the technical write up has been turned in and will be published in the 2019 proceedings. The paper and findings will be shared at my presentation. I am excited and nervous about the presentation as it will be my first ever talk at a conference. I am definitely more excited than nervous though!
